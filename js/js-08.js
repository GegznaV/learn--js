// 44:33 - Engines and Runtime Environments

/*
JS engines:
- V8 is chrome's engine
- SpiderMonkey is FireFox's engine

EcmaScript (ES) – is a standard on which JS is implemented.
Test 272 is a test that quantifies how good JS implementation is (how well it follows Ecma standard)

Engine is a processor.
Environment is a location.

Engine is a part of JS environment.
Environment is usually in a browser.
But can be in NodeJS, where V8 engine is used.

JS is more like compiled. It is because of how the engines work.
JIT – just in time compilation.
